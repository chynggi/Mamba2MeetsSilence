- Keep functions focused and modular

### Formatting

Format your code with Black before committing:

```bash

```bash
mypy models/ data/ training/ inference/ utils/
```

### Linting

```bash
flake8 models/ data/ training/ inference/ utils/
```

## Testing

Write tests for new features and bug fixes:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
